Overview
--------
This document covers the common tasks in keeping the Microsoft kernel
git tree in sync with upstream changes.

Conventions
-----------
The Microsoft Linux kernel git tree for stable releases is organized
in a similar manner. The names and tags correspond to upstream; i.e the
stable branch for 4.13 kernel upstream is called "linux-4.13.y" and
the branch with Microsoft related patches is "msft-4.13.y".
The actual versions are also tagged (linux-4.13.1 and msft-4.13.1).

Updating the master branch
--------------------------
The master branch should be an exact match of Linus upstream tree.
This helps when tracking commit id's and doing cherry-picks.
The merge for this is straight forward.

  # Get Microsoft kernel tree 
  $ git clone linuxonhyperv.com:/home/msftkernel/git/linux-msft.git
  
  # Merge from upstream
  $ git pull \
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

  # Get any tags
  $ git fetch --tags \
  	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

  # Push results
  $ git push; git push --tags

Updating from upstream stable
-----------------------------
The upstream Linux stable kernel updates often (about weekly) based on
bug and security fixes from upstream. The stable kernels are found on
separate branches per version in:
 http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
 
To update the Microsoft kernel when a new stable kernel is released
involves merging the branches. The steps for 4.13 would be:

  # Get Microsoft kernel tree 
  $ git clone linuxonhyperv.com:/home/msftkernel/git/linux-msft.git
  
  # Checkout the the stable branch
  $ git checkout msft-4.13.y
  
  # Merge in branch from upstream
  $ git pull \
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git \
	linux-4.13.y

  # Get stable tags
  $ git fetch --tags \
  	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git

  # Do a test build
  $ cp Microsoft/config-azure .config
  $ make oldconfig
  $ make
  
  # Tag and push result
  $ git tag msft-4.13.3
  $ git push; git push --tags
  
Note: These steps are simplified, feel free to use local clones and
git worktree if you understand how to use these.

Creating release candidate branches
-----------------------------------
When Linus puts out a new release candidate, the process is a little
more complex because some of the patches in the Microsoft kernel may
have been incorporated (or overlap other changes). These assume master
branch already is updated from Linus tree.

In general, the process for a new rc release is most complex:

  # Get latest Microsoft kernel tree
  $ git clone linuxonhyperv.com:/home/msftkernel/git/linux-msft.git
  
  # Get patch files for all the MSFT patches
  $ git checkout msft-4.13.y
  $ git format-patch v4.13.3

There will now be a lot of files starting with 0001-... that are the
individual patches. The next step is to apply them to a new branch
either with 'git am' or use patch and commit manually.

  # Make new rc branch
  $ git checkout -b msft-4.14-rc1 v4.14-rc1
  
  # Apply one or more patches (repeat until done)
  $ git am 0001-*.patch
  
One important step is that the kernel config options often change
between versions. Therefore you should update the archived
kernel config
  $ cd <linux-msft directory>
  $ cp Microsoft/config-azure .config
  $ make oldconfig
  $ cp .config Microsoft/config-azure
  $ git commit Microsoft/config-azure

Since this requires lots of patches, make sure and do build
and test before pushing the result for others to use.
  
You could in theory do 'git am *.patch' but not all patches will apply
cleanly. Some need to be skipped, and others may require rework by
merging with patch command then redoing commit.

Updating from -rc1 to -rc2 is usually much simpler. Assuming you
have already updated master.
 $ git clone linuxonhyperv.com:/home/msftkernel/git/linux-msft.git
 $ git checkout -b msft-4.14-rc2 v4.14-rc2

 # Now get Microsoft changes from -rc1
 $ git pull . msft-4.14-rc1
 
 # Finally rebase to move patch tree
 $ git rebase -i v4.14-rc2

This last step also allows combining or dropping patches that are no
longer appropriate. Make sure and test the resulting tree.

Creating new release branches
-----------------------------
Creating a new release branch follows same merge and rebase as the
-rc branches. The only difference is the naming since the release
branch is the start of a new stable branch.
